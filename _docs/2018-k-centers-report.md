excerpt: 'This report was part of a class project on graph mining and data clustering. The aim was to implement an incremental and dynamic version of the k-means clustering algorithm. When a new datapoint was added, the algorithm had to partly recluster the data, if it was needed. The dataset consisted of tweet GPS coordinates.'

This report was part of a class project on graph mining and data clustering. The aim was to implement an incremental and dynamic version of the k-means clustering algorithm. When a new datapoint was added, the algorithm had to partly recluster the data, if it was needed. The dataset consisted of tweet GPS coordinates.
