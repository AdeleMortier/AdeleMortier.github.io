excerpt: 'This report is about inverse problem solving. The aim was to model the dynamics of within-host HIV infection using a differential system whose coefficients were <i>apriori</i> unknown. We designed a custom pipeline that estimated this coefficients by iteratively solving the system (Runge-Kutta order 5 solver), and optimizing the coefficients (Nelder-Mead simplex).'

This report is about inverse problem solving. The aim was to model the dynamics of within-host HIV infection using a differential system whose coefficients were <i>apriori</i> unknown. We designed a custom pipeline that estimated this coefficients by iteratively solving the system (Runge-Kutta order 5 solver), and optimizing the coefficients (Nelder-Mead simplex).
