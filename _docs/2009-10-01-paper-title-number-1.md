excerpt: 'This report is about the analysis of DNA sequences form Parkinsonian and caridac patients. I trimmed, filtered, and aligned DNA sequences using several softwares (Bowtie 2, GATK), in order to prepare these data for variant discovery. I found several genes that presented unsual mutation and that were linked with the pathologies of the patients.'

This report is about the analysis of DNA sequences form Parkinsonian and caridac patients. I trimmed, filtered, and aligned DNA sequences using several softwares (Bowtie 2, GATK), in order to prepare these data for variant discovery. I found several genes that presented unsual mutation and that were linked with the pathologies of the patients.
