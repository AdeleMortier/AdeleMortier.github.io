excerpt: 'This report is about the analysis of DNA sequences form Parkinsonian and caridac patients. I trimmed, filtered, and aligned DNA sequences using several softwares (Bowtie 2, GATK), in order to prepare these data for variant discovery. I found several genes that presented unsual mutation and that were linked with the pathologies of the patients.'
